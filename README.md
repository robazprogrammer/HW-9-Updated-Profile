# HW 9 Updated Portfolio Site
The updated site uses a basic template from Colorlib which I have customized by adding a row of images and links to my favorite projects.
I have linked 1 project and three (3) homework assignments: these same projects are also posted to my Linkedin profile.

My Linkedin profile can be accessed here:
